# contact-list
Contact List React App

This React app allows you to manage contacts by fetching data from an external API and performing CRUD operations locally (dummy calls to an API).

### Features:

1.  Fetch and Show Users: Retrieve contacts from the API [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users) and display them in the app.
    
2.  Add a Contact: Create a new contact and save it in the React state. A POST call is made to the above URL, but no actual contact is added to the server.
    
3.  Update a Contact: Update an existing contact and make a PUT call to the API (dummy call).
    
4.  Delete a Contact: Remove a contact from the list and make a DELETE call to the API (dummy call).

2.  Install dependencies:

4.  Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
